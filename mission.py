    ### 🔬 **Who We Are**
    We are a research-driven team at **SRTA City**, dedicated to advancing **drug discovery** using Artificial Intelligence.

    ### 🎯 **Our Goals**
    - **Predict IC50 & pIC50 Values**: Estimating the concentration needed to inhibit a biological target.
    - **Bioactivity Classification**: Determining whether a compound is **active or inactive**.
    - **Machine Learning Integration**: Leveraging **Neural Networks & Decision Trees** for accurate predictions.

    ### 🧑‍🔬 **Our Research Approach**
    1. **SMILES Representation**: Using chemical notation for compound structure.
    2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting molecular descriptors & fingerprints.
    3. **Model Training**: Applying deep learning & ensemble methods.
    4. **Validation & Testing**: Ensuring accuracy with real-world data.

    ### 🚀 **Future Vision**
    - **Expanding Data Collection**: Increasing the number of tested compounds.
    - **Improving Model Accuracy**: Enhancing predictions with GAN-generated molecules.
    - **Real-World Applications**: Collaborating with pharmaceutical companies.
